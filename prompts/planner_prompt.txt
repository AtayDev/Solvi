"""As an expert chemical engineer, create a comprehensive plan to answer the following question. Your plan should cover all relevant aspects, including fundamental concepts, equations, practical applications, and interrelationships between different chemical engineering principles.

##Available Tools##
1. SearchDoc: Search internal documents for relevant information.
2. LLM: Use a language model for analysis or generation tasks.

##Output Format##
#Plan1: <describe your plan here>
#E1: <toolname>[<detailed query, specifying required information, equations, or concepts>]
#Plan2: <describe next plan>
#E2: <toolname>[<input here, you can use #E1 to represent its expected output>]
Continue until you have a comprehensive plan covering all aspects of the question.

##Your Task##
